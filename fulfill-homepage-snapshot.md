Founded and owned by ecommerce operators, Red Stag was built on the belief that fulfillment delivers your brand. While Red Stag’s history and DNA are in big, heavy, and bulky products with both parcel and freight shipping capabilities, the company also handles smaller items at higher volumes and lower SKU counts, including accessories that accompany larger products. The company handles DTC parcels, DTC pallets, retail pallets to stores like Walmart and Target, and comprehensive Amazon solutions, including FBA prep, Seller Fulfilled Prime, and FBM fulfillment. The company's guarantees set it apart: zero shrinkage, order accuracy, on-time shipping with same-day options available, and fast receiving. If Red Stag misses a guarantee, they pay clients for the mistake. Red Stag's U.S.-based, in-house Client Success Team has deep fulfillment experience and a direct line to the warehouse floor when issues arise. A dedicated onboarding team ensures a seamless transition—at no extra cost. Red Stag operates two strategically located warehouses totaling 1.2 million square feet in Sweetwater, TN and Salt Lake City, UT. This allows brands to reach 96% of the U.S. within 2 days with ground shipping while minimizing costs. The company's dedicated logistics team simplifies inventory's journey from port to warehouse and handles outbound pallet and freight shipping coordination. Red Stag offers omnichannel fulfillment across DTC, retail, and marketplace channels. The company provides direct integrations to major platforms like Amazon and Shopify, middleware integrations for additional platform connections, and custom API options for complex fulfillment requirements."

In 1998, we opened our logistics expertise to other brands, and KDS was born. Today, we're a 3PL built differently. We're brand operators serving brand builders who need a partner that truly gets it. We're best for brands scaling across retail and DTC who import product and need both operational excellence and financial advantages. Nearly all our 2.9M sq.ft. is FTZ-designated, saving customers millions through duty deferral, MPF reductions, and cash flow optimization. We handle the complexity of both retail compliance (99.93%) and DTC fulfillment (99.98% on-time) because we've done both ourselves. Our recent Savannah acquisition added 673K sq.ft. plus a 24/7 drayage fleet, while our new 855K Perris facility expands West Coast capacity. We own most of our facilities and the land around them, ensuring stability and expansion capacity as you grow. From GOH and kitting to cross-dock and last-mile, we bring enterprise technology, decades of experience, and the perspective of operators who've sat in your chair. Let's talk about building something together.

            - img [ref=e922]
          - paragraph [ref=e926]: Our matching process combines technology and personal consultation. First, you share your business requirements through our questionnaire. For complex needs, we schedule a brief call to understand your requirements in detail. Our team then analyzes your needs against our database of pre-vetted 3PLs and secures interest from appropriate providers. Only after confirming 3PL interest do we present these matches to you. You then select which 3PLs you'd like to connect with, creating a double opt-in process that ensures mutual interest before any introductions.

          - paragraph [ref=e936]: Yes, our matching service is completely free for businesses seeking 3PL partners. There's no catch - we're able to offer this service at no cost because we receive compensation from 3PLs when successful matches lead to partnerships. This model ensures we're incentivized to make quality matches that work for both parties.

We evaluate their operational capabilities, technology infrastructure, financial stability, and client satisfaction rates. We continuously monitor performance metrics and regularly update our database. Only providers with proven track records remain in our network, ensuring you're connected with truly reliable partners.

Most businesses select their preferred partner within 2 - 4 weeks after reviewing matches. The implementation timeline varies based on complexity, but typically ranges from 2 - 8 weeks. Our team provides guidance throughout this process to ensure a smooth transition.
